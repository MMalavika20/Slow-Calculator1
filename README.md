# Slow-Calculator1
Slow Calculator is a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) but with a deliberate delay before showing the result. It simulates a “thinking” process, making it fun, interactive, and a bit frustrating — just like a slow human calculator.
